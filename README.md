This project was developed for the CS1116 module. It features a stock market simulator. Stock prices are determined by randomised functions and historic prices are calculated using stored initial conditions. The admin users are able to add more stocks. Users can also gamble their earnings in a simple coin-flip like scenario. Stock prices and user's investment/earnings can be viewed on graphs or on a leaderboard. There are many flaws in the costs of the stocks, but the formulas work as a proof of concept.
